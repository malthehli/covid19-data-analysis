# covid19-data-analysis

This Project aims to analyzing Covid-19 data in the United States individually(per – state), the file I am using is called “COVID19_state.csv” it contains all the states with the given information such as how many people tested and how many are positive and so on. This data file contains 51 rows and 26 columns but I used only 5 columns that I will need in this report that are State , Tested , Infected , Deaths , Population. Using this dataset I will try to alalyse the data in each state by knowing which state has the more deaths or the total number if infection in United states.
